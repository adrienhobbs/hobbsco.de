## Overview

In this article, I'll review the concept of recursion, and build a Vue.js composable utilizing recursion and the requestAnimationFrame API. This composable will execute a callback function repeatedly for a specified duration, while allowing to pause, resume, and reset the function's execution at any point. By the end of this article, you'll have a better understanding of how recursion works, and a useRaf composable that will come in handy in a future article.

## What Exactly is Recursion?

Recursion involves a function calling itself, either directly or indirectly, until it reaches a specific condition. In general, recursion should be used when it simplifies the problem or leads to a more elegant and understandable solution. It should be avoided if it creates performance or memory issues.

In [Mastering JavaScript Functional Programming](https://amzn.to/41qXbuv), the author defines recursion:

> Recursion is the most potent tool for developing algorithms and a great aid for solving large classes of problems. The idea is that a function can at a certain point call itself, and when that call is done, continue working with whatever result it has received.

## Structuring A Recursive Function

So let's move on to a quick recursive example to help illustrate how to structure a recursive function. Every recursive function should have two parts. A _base case_, and a _recursive case_.

### The Base Case

Specifying a base case signals our function to stop recursing, otherwise it will call itself infinitely, attempting to run `FOR-EV-ER`.

Below, the infiniteCountdown function doesn't have a `base case` and will result in an call stack error.

![Recursion Example](/static/images/an-intro-to-recursion-use-raf/useCountdown.png)

In the countdown function, the base case is on `line 8`: `if (count < 0) return`. Without the base case, this function would continue to countdown past zero, towards -infinity (in reality though, this function will just crash).

### The Recursive Case

The recursive case is on `line 10`: `countdown(count - 1)`. Execute any necessary logic here, and recursively call the function.
In the countdown function we simply call the countdown function, passing it `count - 1` as a parameter. This will always be called until our base case is met.

So now that you have a basic understanding of recursion, let's discuss how I'll integrate recursion into this useRaf composable with the requestAnimationFrame api.

## Enter RequestAnimationFrame

So let's talk about RequestAnimationFrame (RAF). RAF is a method provided by modern web browsers that allows for efficient and synchronized rendering of animations and visual effects. It provides a way to schedule animations and other visual effects in a way that works with the browser's rendering pipeline. This results in smoother, more efficient animations that are less likely to cause visual glitches or consume excessive system resources. Usually, the number of callbacks is approximately 60 times per second, but will generally match the display refresh rate in most web browsers as per the W3C recommendation. Read more about RAF on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame).]

Generally speaking, the role of RAF is to continuously run a specific callback, 60 times per second, continuously, or until a _base case_ is hit! A perfect example to learn about recursion. Let's move on.

## Build Something Already!

Okay okay, let's get the heart of this article. What am I building?

> This useRAF composable will accept a callback function, a duration, and a flag determining if we should run the callback function immediately, or wait until the start function is called. It should return an API that allows for the starting, pausing, resuming, and resetting of the callback execution. Using the requestAnimationFrame it will run the callback for a specified duration, returning progress, timeElapsed, and timestamp variables.

The intent of the composable will become more apparent in a future article, where I'll depend on this useRaf composable to create smooth and performant animations.

So here's how I envision our callback being implemented: `const { pause, start, reset } = useRaf(cb, 5000, false)`.

## The Code

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { onBeforeUnmount } from 'vue'
interface CallbackArgs {
  progress: number
  timeElapsed: number
  timestamp: DOMHighResTimeStamp
}

export function useRaf(callback: (args: CallbackArgs) => void, duration: number, immediate = true) {
  let requestID: number | null
  let progress: number | null
  let previousTimestamp = 0
  let totalDelta = 0
  let isActive = false

  function loop(timestamp: DOMHighResTimeStamp) {
    if (!isActive) {
      isActive = true
      previousTimestamp = timestamp
    }

    totalDelta = totalDelta + timestamp - previousTimestamp

    progress = totalDelta / duration

    if (totalDelta > duration && requestID) {
      cancelAnimationFrame(requestID)
      requestID = null
      isActive = false

      return
    }

    callback({ timestamp, timeElapsed: totalDelta, progress: parseFloat(progress.toFixed(2)) })

    previousTimestamp = timestamp
    requestID = requestAnimationFrame(loop)
  }

  function start() {
    if (isActive) return
    requestID = requestAnimationFrame(loop)
  }

  function pause() {
    if (requestID) {
      cancelAnimationFrame(requestID)
      isActive = false
    }
  }

  function reset() {
    if (requestID) {
      cancelAnimationFrame(requestID)
    }
    isActive = false
    progress = null
    previousTimestamp = 0
    totalDelta = 0
    isActive = false
    requestID = null

    callback({ timestamp: 0, timeElapsed: 0, progress: 0 })
  }

  if (immediate) start()
  onBeforeUnmount(reset)

  return {
    start,
    pause,
    reset,
  }
}
```

### Variable Declarations (lines 9-13)

```typescript
let requestID: number | null
let progress: number | null
let previousTimestamp = 0
let totalDelta = 0
let isActive = false
```

I'll start by declaring the following variables:

- `requestID` is the ID returned by requestAnimationFrame.
  - we persist this id so we can cancel the animation frame when pausing or resetting the execution of our callback.
- `progress` is the current progress of the loop execution, represented as a floatng point number between 0-1.
- `previousTimestamp` is the timestamp of the previous animation frame.
  - we'll use this to calculate how much time has passed since the last execution.
- `totalDelta` is the total time elapsed during the loop execution.
  - this keeps track of the time elapsed since the first execution of our callback.
- `isActive` is a flag to determine if the loop is currently active.

### The Loop Function

```typescript
function loop(timestamp: DOMHighResTimeStamp) {
  if (!isActive) {
    isActive = true
    previousTimestamp = timestamp
  }

  totalDelta = totalDelta + timestamp - previousTimestamp

  progress = totalDelta / duration

  if (totalDelta > duration && requestID) {
    cancelAnimationFrame(requestID)
    requestID = null
    isActive = false

    return
  }

  callback({ timestamp, timeElapsed: totalDelta, progress: parseFloat(progress.toFixed(2)) })

  previousTimestamp = timestamp
  requestID = requestAnimationFrame(loop)
}
```

I'll begin the loop function by checking if our execution is already active. If not, we need to set our previousTimeStamp variable to the timestamp RAF is passing us. This will allow us to calculate the totalDelta correctly, which will evaluate to 0 on the first execution. Subsequent executions will update `previousTimeStamp` _AFTER_ our `totalDelta` has been calculated. If I always updated `previousTimeStamp` before the `totalDelta` calculation, the `totalDelta` would always evaluate to zero!

It should be noted that I'm using `totalDelta` because the callback execution can be paused. Without pause functionality, I could simply check if `timeStamp - previousTimeStamp` is greater than the duration to determine if execution should stop. But since we can pause the playback, wait a few seconds, and continue execution, I wouldn't be able to calculate how much time the execution has been running for without keeping track of multiple timestamps. This seeme like unecessary complexity. Instead, tracking the actual running time of the execution provides a much easier way determine the state of the execution.

> Only write as much code as is needed. Anything extra is complexity that will become a burden. <br/><br/> -- Pete Goodliffe in [Becoming a Better Programmer](https://amzn.to/41FSQ74)

Next, if the duration of the execution has been surpassed, I'll cancel the next execution of the callback and end the function with a return statement.

Finally, if still active, I'll execute the callback with the timestamp, timeElapsed, and progress data, update the previousTimeStamp to equal the currentTimeStamp so we can utilize it to calculate our totalDelta in the next execution, and update the requestId to our next requestAnimateFrame ID.

### The Start, Pause, and Reset Functions

```typescript
function start() {
  if (isActive) return
  requestID = requestAnimationFrame(loop)
}

function pause() {
  if (requestID) {
    cancelAnimationFrame(requestID)
    isActive = false
  }
}

function reset() {
  if (requestID) {
    cancelAnimationFrame(requestID)
  }
  isActive = false
  progress = null
  previousTimestamp = 0
  totalDelta = 0
  isActive = false
  requestID = null

  callback({ timestamp: 0, timeElapsed: 0, progress: 0 })
}
```

These are all relatively straightforward functions, so I won't go into much detail about them. Review them at your discretion!

## Usage

Sheesh! That was a lot of work! Let's put this to use, in a not so exciting demo. I'll showcase the functionality, by controlling our functions execution with start, pause, and reset buttons, while displaying the `currentProgress` and `timeRemaining` variables.

```typescript
const currentProgress = ref(0)
const time = ref(0)

const { pause, start, reset } = useRaf(
  ({ progress, timeElapsed }) => {
    currentProgress.value = progress
    time.value = timeElapsed
  },
  3000,
  false
)
```
